# Reservations implementations fork (also free heroku hosting üòç)
I'been working in parallel with givemeturn repos, where they were for research purpose, into this were wrote a correct implementation (or almost xd)

These are the implementation of `Reservations` in `uncmorfi`, using the [forked backend](https://github.com/joaqbarcena/UNCmorfiServer) (maybe for now)

It hasn't almost anything of testing other than my self, so its possible than this catalogue as `negrada` :D
